Welcome to the APU Programming Café Management System, a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the management of coaching classes offered by the APU Programming Café. This initiative aims to provide additional guidance and support to students across all academic levels, from Foundation to Degree programs, helping them strengthen their programming skills.

Our system offers three levels of coaching for each programming module: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Students who require extra coaching can be enrolled by their module lecturers or request to join additional classes. Each class spans three months and is conducted by trained and experienced trainers. Fees apply based on the class level, and only students who have completed their payments can attend sessions.

The APU Programming Café Management System features four types of registered users, each with distinct roles and permissions:
	•	Admin – Manages the system, oversees operations, and handles user accounts.
	•	Trainer – Conducts coaching classes and manages students.
	•	Lecturer – Identifies students who need extra coaching and enrolls them in the appropriate classes.
	•	Student – Attends coaching sessions and handles payment for classes.

By providing a structured and efficient system, the APU Programming Café Management System ensures seamless coordination of coaching classes, empowering students to enhance their programming skills and achieve academic success at APU.
